## Overview
Chest radiographs (x-rays or CXR) are the most common diagnostic imaging test in medicine. Radiographs are intended to address a specific clinical question (e.g. rule out pneumonia), and most are considered "normal." We hypothesized that normal radiographs also contain "hidden" information about health and longevity that can be extracted using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 

The result is CXR-Risk, a CNN that predicts the risk of 12-year all-cause mortality based on a chest radiograph image. Persons in the highest CXR-risk category had a 53% 12-year mortality rate, 18-fold higher than the lowest risk. Prognostic value was independent of the radiologists' diagnostic findings (e.g. lung nodule) and standard risk factors (e.g. age, sex, diabetes). Please refer to the [JAMA Open manuscript](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2738349) for details.
